# SpringBootAngular2
This is a sample application for the integration of spring boot and angular 2.
The project is packaged as a single war, to allow it to be deployed on any tomcat 8 web server.
Angular material has been included to allow us to build an app using material design components.

To get going, mvn clean install from the pom in the parent directory.
War generated in target directory can be deployed to wherever you need.

Todo:
- Check wether jar packaging works.
- allow for front end dev using npm serve.
